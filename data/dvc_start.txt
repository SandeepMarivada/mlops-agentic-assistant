How cool would it be to track large datasets and machine learning models
alongside your code, sidestepping all the limitations of storing it in Git?
Imagine cloning a repository and immediately seeing your datasets, checkpoints
and models staged in your workspace. Imagine switching to a different version of
a 100Gb file in less than a second with a
git checkout
.
💫 DVC is your
"Git for data"
!
Installing DVC
First things first, let's install DVC. The easiest way to install dvc is with
uv
or
pipx
:
$
uv
tool
install
dvc
# or,
$
pipx
install
dvc
Once it's installed, verify dvc is available by running:
$
dvc
--help
If you see a help message listing dvc commands, you are good to continue!
See the
Installation Guide
for more installation options.
Initializing a project
Before we begin, settle on a directory for this guide. Everything we will do
will be self contained there.
⚙️ Expand to prepare a project.
Imagine we want to build an ML project from scratch. Let's start by creating a
Git repository:
$
mkdir
example-get-started
$
cd
example-get-started
$
git init
This directory name is used in our
example-get-started
repo.
Inside your chosen directory, we will use our current working directory as a
DVC project
. Let's initialize it by running
dvc init
inside a Git
project:
$
dvc init
A few
internal files
are created
that should be added to Git:
$
git status
Changes to be committed:
new file:   .dvc/.gitignore
new file:   .dvc/config
...
$
git commit
-m
"Initialize DVC"
Now you're ready to DVC!
Tracking data
Working inside an
initialized project
directory, let's pick a piece of data to work with. We'll use an example
data.xml
file, though any text or binary file (or directory) will do. Start by
running:
$
dvc get
https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry
\
get-started/data.xml
-o
data/data.xml
We used
dvc get
above to show how DVC can turn any Git repo into a "
data
registry
".
dvc get
can download any file or directory tracked in a
DVC
repository
.
Use
dvc add
to start tracking the dataset file:
$
dvc add
data/data.xml
DVC stores information about the added file in a special
.dvc
file named
data/data.xml.dvc
. This small, human-readable metadata file acts as a
placeholder for the original data for the purpose of Git tracking.
Next, run the following commands to track changes in Git:
$
git add
data/data.xml.dvc data/.gitignore
$
git commit
-m
"Add raw data"
Now the
metadata about your data
is versioned alongside your source code,
while the original data file was added to
.gitignore
.
💡 Expand to get a peek under the hood
dvc add
moved the data to the project's
cache
, and
linked
it back to the
workspace
. The
.dvc/cache
will
look like this:
.dvc/cache/files/md5
└── 22
└── a1a2931c8370d3aeedd7183606fd7f
The hash value of the
data.xml
file we just added (
22a1a29...
) determines
the cache path shown above. And if you check
data/data.xml.dvc
, you will find
it there too:
outs
:
-
md5
:
22a1a2931c8370d3aeedd7183606fd7f
path
:
data.xml
Storing and sharing
You can upload DVC-tracked data to a variety of storage systems (remote or
local) referred to as
"remotes"
.
For simplicity, we will use a "local remote" for this guide, which is just a
directory in the local file system.
Configuring a remote
Before pushing data to a remote we need to set it up using the
dvc remote add
command:
Mac/Linux
$
mkdir
/tmp/dvcstore
$
dvc remote add
-d
myremote /tmp/dvcstore
Windows (Cmd)
$
mkdir
%TEMP%/dvcstore
$
dvc remote add
-d
myremote %TEMP%
\
dvcstore
DVC supports many remote
storage types
, including Amazon S3, NFS, SSH, Google
Drive, Azure Blob Storage, and HDFS.
An example for a common use case is configuring an
Amazon S3
remote:
$
dvc remote add
-d
storage s3://mybucket/dvcstore
For this to work, you'll need an AWS account and credentials set up to allow
access.
To learn more about storage remotes, see the
Remote Storage Guide
.
Uploading data
Now that a storage remote was configured, run
dvc push
to upload data:
$
dvc push
💡 Expand to get a peek under the hood
dvc push
copied the data
cached
locally to the remote storage we
set up earlier. The remote storage directory should look like this:
.../dvcstore/files/md5
└── 22
└── a1a2931c8370d3aeedd7183606fd7f
Usually, we would also want to Git track any code changes that led to the data
change (
git add
,
git commit
and
git push
).
Retrieving data
Once DVC-tracked data and models are stored remotely, they can be downloaded
with
dvc pull
when needed (e.g. in other copies of this
project
).
Usually, we run it after
git pull
or
git clone
.
Let's try this now:
$
dvc pull
Expand to simulate a "fresh pull"
After running
dvc push
above, the
dvc pull
command afterwards was
short-circuited by DVC for efficiency. The project's
data/data.xml
file, our
cache
and the remote storage were all already in sync. We need to
empty the
cache
and delete
data/data.xml
from our project if we
want to have DVC actually moving data around. Let's do that now:
Mac/Linux
$
rm
-rf
.dvc/cache
$
rm
-f
data/data.xml
Windows (Cmd)
$
rmdir
.dvc
\
cache
$
del
data
\
data.xml
Now we can run
dvc pull
to retrieve the data from the remote:
$
dvc pull
Making local changes
Next, let's say we obtained more data from some external source. We will
simulate this by doubling the dataset contents:
Mac/Linux
$
cp
data/data.xml /tmp/data.xml
$
cat
/tmp/data.xml
>>
data/data.xml
Windows (Cmd)
$
copy
data
\
data.xml %TEMP%
\
data.xml
$
type
%TEMP%
\
data.xml
>>
data
\
data.xml
After modifying the data, run
dvc add
again to track the latest version:
$
dvc add
data/data.xml
Now we can run
dvc push
to upload the changes to the remote storage, followed
by a
git commit
to track them:
$
dvc push
$
git commit
data/data.xml.dvc
-m
"Dataset updates"
Switching between versions
A commonly used workflow is to use
git checkout
to switch to a branch or
checkout a specific
.dvc
file revision, followed by a
dvc checkout
to sync
data into your
workspace
:
$
git checkout
<
..
.
>
$
dvc checkout
Return to a previous version of the dataset
Let's go back to the original version of the data:
$
git checkout
HEAD~1 data/data.xml.dvc
$
dvc checkout
Let's commit it (no need to do
dvc push
this time since this original version
of the dataset was already saved):
$
git commit
data/data.xml.dvc
-m
"Revert dataset updates"
As you can see, DVC is technically not a version control system by itself! It
manipulates
.dvc
files, whose contents define the data file versions. Git is
already used to version your code, and now it can also version your data
alongside it.
Following This Guide
To help you understand and use DVC better, consider the following three
use-cases:
data pipelines
,
experiment tracking
and
model management
.
You may pick any to start learning about how DVC helps you "solve" that
scenario!
Choose a trail to jump into its first chapter:
Data Pipelines
- Use DVC as a build system for reproducible, data driven
pipelines.
Experiment Management
- Easily track your experiments and their progress
by only instrumenting your code, and collaborate on ML experiments like
software engineers do for code.
Model Registry
- Use the DVC model registry to manage the lifecycle of
your models in an auditable way. Easily access your models and integrate your
model registry actions into CICD pipelines to follow GitOps best practices.
