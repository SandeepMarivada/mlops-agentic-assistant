Chroma gives you everything you need for retrieval: store embeddings with metadata, search with dense and sparse vectors, filter by metadata, and retrieve across text, images, and more.
​
What Chroma Offers
Document Storage
Store documents and metadata.
Embeddings
Use any embedding model. OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, sentence-transformers, and more.
Vector Search
Dense, sparse, and hybrid search. Query by similarity and combine multiple search strategies.
Full-Text & Regex Search
Keyword and regex search over your data without embeddings.
Metadata Filtering
Filter results at query time by metadata conditions.
Multi-Modal Retrieval
Index and search images, audio, and other modalities alongside text.
​
