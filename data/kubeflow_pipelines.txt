Overview
What is Kubeflow Pipelines?
Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) is a platform for building and deploying portable and scalable machine learning (ML) workflows using containers on Kubernetes-based systems.
With KFP you can author
components
and
pipelines
using the
KFP Python SDK
, compile pipelines to an
intermediate representation YAML
, and submit the pipeline to run on a KFP-conformant backend such as the
open source KFP backend
or
Google Cloud Vertex AI Pipelines
.
The open source KFP backend is available as a core component of Kubeflow or as a standalone installation. To use KFP as part of the Kubeflow platform, follow the instructions for
installing Kubeflow
. To use KFP as a standalone application, follow the
standalone installation
instructions. To get started with your first pipeline, follow the
Getting Started
instructions.
Why Kubeflow Pipelines?
KFP enables data scientists and machine learning engineers to:
Author end-to-end ML workflows natively in Python
Create fully custom ML components or leverage an ecosystem of existing components
Easily pass parameters and ML artifacts between pipeline components
Easily manage, track, and visualize pipeline definitions, runs, experiments, and ML artifacts
Efficiently use compute resources through parallel task execution and through caching to eliminating redundant executions
Keep experimentation and iteration light and Python-centric, minimizing the need to (re)build and maintain containers
Maintain cross-platform pipeline portability through a platform-neutral
IR YAML pipeline definition
What is a pipeline?
A
pipeline
is a definition of a workflow that composes one or more
components
together to form a computational directed acyclic graph (DAG). At runtime, each component execution corresponds to a single container execution, which may create ML artifacts. Pipelines may also feature
control flow
.
