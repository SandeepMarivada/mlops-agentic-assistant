Pipelines
If you find yourself repeating sequence of actions to get or update the results
of your project, then you may already have a pipeline. For example, a data
science workflow could involve:
Gathering data for training and validation
Extracting useful features from the training dataset
(Re)training an ML model
Evaluating the results against the validation set
DVC helps you
define
these stages in a standard YAML format (
.dvc
and
dvc.yaml
files), making your
pipeline
more manageable and
consistent to reproduce.
See
Get Started: Data Pipelines
for a hands-on introduction to this topic.
